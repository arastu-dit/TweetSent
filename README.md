Twitter is a microblogging platform which provides a large amount of usable data. This data can be collected in the form of ‘tweets’ using the Twitter API. This project was developed using Python 3.6.6. It uses different machine learning techniques to categorize a set of real-time tweets based on their emotional magnitude. An existing training dataset was used to train the classifier. A web-based UI was created using Django where the user can enter a query and view real-time results of Sentiment Analysis along with some statistical data. The user can use multiple classifiers with customized parameters and compare their performance on a set of classified tweets.
